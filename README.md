# Yo, whatâ€™s up â€” Hawks here, number two hero. The wind carried your name to me. You call, I fly. Whatâ€™s the occasion?

<p align="center"><strong>   This nestâ€™s for chill people only â€” the ones who can take a joke, respect boundaries, and know when to rest their wings.
I donâ€™t care what fandom youâ€™re from or how many followers youâ€™ve got â€” just be kind, be real, and donâ€™t act like you own the sky.
If youâ€™re out here spreading negativity, picking fights, or trying to control how others live? Stay grounded. Youâ€™re not cleared for takeoff. </strong></p>

<p align="center"><strong>  INT if you love stories, late-night chats, and that quiet kind of connection that doesnâ€™t need to be loud to be real.
If you like warmth, soft energy, and conversations that go from joking to deep in seconds â€” yeah, weâ€™ll get along.

Iâ€™m drawn to people who stay genuine â€” who care without needing to prove it.
If youâ€™ve got a good heart and a sharp mind, Iâ€™m already interested.

Stick around if you like open skies, dry humor, dumb jokes, and people who mean what they say.
I donâ€™t need perfect â€” just honest.  </strong></p>
