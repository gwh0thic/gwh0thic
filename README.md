<p align="center"><strong>   This nestâ€™s for chill people only â€” the ones who can take a joke, respect boundaries, and know when to rest their wings.
I donâ€™t care what fandom youâ€™re from or how many followers youâ€™ve got â€” just be kind, be real, and donâ€™t act like you own the sky.
If youâ€™re out here spreading negativity, picking fights, or trying to control how others live? Stay grounded. Youâ€™re not cleared for takeoff. </strong></p>
